\title{Additional distance functions correlation distance (1-r)}
\usage{
cor.dist(data, methods = "pearson", absolute = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data matrix ([data.frame object] row: metabolites,
col: samples or replicates)}

\item{methods}{a character string indicating which correlation coefficient is to be calculated. One of "pearson" (default), "spearman", or "kendall" can be abbreviated.}

\item{absolute}{TRUE means that absolute value of the correlation coefficient is used (Default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
the resulting correlation matrix
}

\details{
These functions were originally from 'hybridHclust' package.
We modified the functions slightly. See also the reference manual in detail.
